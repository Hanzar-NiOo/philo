POSIX thread (pthread) libraries

=> The POSIX thread libraries are a standards based thread API for C/C++.
(i)		allows one to spawn a new concurrent process flow
(ii)	most effective on multi-processor or multi-core systems
		=> where the process flow can be scheduled to run on another processor
		thus gaining speed through parallel or distributed processing
(iii)	Threads require less overhead than "forking" or spawning a new process
(iv)	gains are also found on uniprocessor systems
		which exploit latency in I/O and other system functions which may halt process execution	
	*** (One thread may execute while another is waiting for I/O or some other system latency.)***
(v)		Parallel programming technologies such as MPI and PVM are used in a distributed computing
		environment while threads are limited to a single computer system
(vi)	All threads within a process share the same address space
(vii)	A thread is spawned by defining a function and it's arguments
		=> which will be processed in the thread

***The purpose of using the POSIX thread library in your software is to execute software faster.***

Thread Basics:

		=>	Thread operations include
(i)		thread creation
(ii)	termination
(iii)	synchronization (joins,blocking)
(iv)	scheduling
(v)		data management
(vi)	process interaction.

		=>	A thread does not maintain a list of created threads,nor does it know the thread
			that created it.

		=>	Threads in the same process share:
(i)		Process instructions
(ii)	Most data
(iii)	open files (descriptors)
(iv)	signals and signal handlers
(v)		current working directory
(vi)	User and group id

		=>	Each thread has a unique:
(i)		Thread ID
(ii)	set of registers, stack pointer
(iii)	stack for local variables, return addresses
(iv)	signal mask
(v)		priority
(vi)	Return value: errno

		=>	pthread functions return "0" if OK.

Thread Creation and Termination:

int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine) (void *),
					void *arg);

Arguments: ***
thread - returns the thread id. (unsigned long int defined in bits/pthreadtypes.h)
attr - Set to NULL if default thread attributes are used. (else define members of the struct pthread_attr_t defined in bits/pthreadtypes.h) Attributes include:
(i)		detached state (joinable? Default: PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE. Other option: PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED)
(ii)	scheduling policy (real-time? PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED,PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED,SCHED_OTHER)
		scheduling parameter
(iii)	inheritsched attribute (Default: PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED Inherit from parent thread: PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED)
(iv)	scope (Kernel threads: PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM User threads: PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS Pick one or the other not both.)
		guard size
(v)		stack address (See unistd.h and bits/posix_opt.h _POSIX_THREAD_ATTR_STACKADDR)
(vi)	stack size (default minimum PTHREAD_STACK_SIZE set in pthread.h),
(vii)	void * (*start_routine) - pointer to the function to be threaded. Function has a single argument: pointer to void.
(viii)	*arg - pointer to argument of function. To pass multiple arguments, send a pointer to a structure.

Function call: pthread_exit
    void pthread_exit(void *retval);
    
Arguments:
retval - Return value of thread.
